[now any changes you made in the file if you push the command it will push to the branch that you have mentioned in the command.]
we have made some changes in the file and want to push the changes to our remote repository on a particular branch. By using the command ‘git push,’ the local repository’s files can be synced with the remote repository on Github.

10. git log
    The “git log” command is handy when we want to examine the detailed log of every commit in our repository. By executing this command, we can view the log specific to the branch we are currently in. Additionally, we can use “git log -3” to display the last three logs.
